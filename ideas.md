# Vanilla Node Projects

This was intended to be a "beginners projects" repository. Then I realized I don't like to call it like that, because this don't actually define the project, but encourages or discourages you to use it regarding to your self-perception. Is kind of saying "use this repository if you think you have no idea". Instead of that I'd rather say: "repository with projects under certain rules".

## The Rules

### There shall be no browser.

All the interaction in real time will be through the terminal. _Why?_

At the end of the day, most of this repository is kind-of a js gimnastics exercise, more als practice than als actual real-life oriented

### Edge-Terminal

Still, let's try to make a browser out of the terminal. For that we'll have an approach that is as similar as possible to the one we'd use on a browser. With that we will:

- realize what features a browser has
- build just once, not a skillset for node and a skillset for browser

_but they are two different things..._

yes, and no one cares about it. Stop confusing people. Do you have a UX/UI? Yes, a very minimalistic and constrained on the terminal. You still can work with concepts like components. There's no reason to split the worlds. It's just not efficient.

### No fancy libraries shall be installed

For the most part. Almost never. Hopefully.

The Goal is to make things ourselves. Again: because we can

Nonetheless, some processes are unnecessery tedious. For instance, nodemon will be used. Because there's no point in calling node x.js file every time a character was changed.

### ES6

There's actual no point, in theory or praxis, of using the old syntax or avoiding "modern" methods, like high-er order functions. If you know loop, nice, glad to read it! Now go and learn map, filter and the alike.

I never, never, never, no exception made, not even once, used a for loop, pop() and many others. Happy to have them, just have better tools. Let's not over-complicated for no reason.

Btw, loop did not helped me to learn a forEach(). This is nonsense. No one understands better a forEach() or a filter() because "they learnt first a do|while". It's just a made-up story based on the traditional linear learning model, which is at it's best not extremely efficient.



## Ideas

### helpers

- print module
  _everything to do with console_

- input module
  _everything to handle the input_

- store module
  _everything to CRUD locally_

- clean data module
  _handles inputted data before storing it_

- format module

### bigger projects

- Notes App
- Todos App
- HTTP server
- Chat App
